üìãProject Overview :

This project focuses on analyzing AtliQ Hardware's retail performance using a MySQL dataset and Power BI. The data set comprises five tables (market, product, date, customer, transaction) and was imported into Power BI using an ODBC connector. The project involves data cleaning, transformation, and measure calculation to derive actionable insights. Data preprocessing was performed using Power Query Editor to handle inconsistent or blank values, and DAX was used to calculate key measures such as Revenue, Profit Margin %, Profit Margin Contribution %, Revenue Contribution %, and Total Expenses. These measures were then used to create four comprehensive reports with visualizations to support strategic decision-making. The project structure is divided into four reports, each addressing specific aspects of sales, profitability, customer behavior, product demand, and performance comparisons, enabling AtliQ Hardware to optimize its retail operations.




üèÜ Business Objectives: 

AtliQ Hardware faces challenges in optimizing its retail operations due to limited visibility into key performance metrics. The company lacks actionable insights into sales trends, profitability drivers, market and customer contributions, and product demand, hindering effective decision-making. Specifically, there is a need to identify high-performing markets, top customers, and in-demand products, while also understanding profit margin variations, expense trends, and performance against profit targets. This project aims to address these gaps by leveraging Power BI to analyze sales, profitability, and customer behavior, enabling AtliQ Hardware to make data-driven decisions to enhance business growth and operational efficiency.The primary objective of this project is to empower Atliq Hardware‚Äôs business teams with actionable sales and market insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. By leveraging historical sales, market, and customer data stored in the MySQL database, the project aims to identify key revenue drivers, monitor sales performance across different markets, evaluate profitability trends, and uncover growth opportunities. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making by providing a centralized, easy-to-understand visual platform that highlights important KPIs, market behaviors, product performances, and customer contributions. Ultimately, this dashboard is designed to help Atliq Hardware optimize sales strategies, improve market positioning, and enhance overall business profitability.
